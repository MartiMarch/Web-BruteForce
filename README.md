# Web-BruteForce
Testing a brute force over a basic Webpage. I use Selenium and Python for scrapping the web and web server is launched over centos 7.


## Installation
<p aling="canter">
Check the version of your broswer and download the <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers">driver</a>. Got to "File", "Settings..." pycharm subdirectory and select "selenium" as interpreter. Now your python code can run Selenium. The next step consists to install a web page to attack. Launch a <a href="http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/">Centos</a> image on <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> and install an apache server with PHP using Ansible. The file <a href="https://github.com/MartiMarch/Ansible/blob/main/html-php.yml">html-php.yml</a> describe via comments how to do it.
